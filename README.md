Good day everyone, I wanted to share my first HyperCasual demo game project. The game has some optimization issues that I'm working on. The reason why it goes into dark mode when I restart the game and finish the level is a problem with Unity, so there is no such problem when I install the game. Since the energy mechanics in the game are better understood at the bottom left, I wanted to take a record from the editor. Apart from these, the game mechanics are not very balanced, but it works properly. After all, that's the main issue, isn't it? :) I am improving myself now, I will solve the problems in the future.
