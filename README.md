The game has some optimization issues i am workinig on it. When i restart the  game and completed level game goes into  dark mode this is problem of unity editor so when i build game there is no problem like that. Except those, the game mechanics is weak but they work so at least the point is this isn't it ? but i will improve my self and solve the issues :)

You can reach video about the game from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibpZw1EvJDg
